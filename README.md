# Simple Server Health

Small PHP script to give a brief overview of the server health. Good for use on shared hosts like cPanel where the dashboard CPU & RAM usage is of only your account and not the entire server.

## Setup
Copy <code>_conf.sample.php</code> to <code>_conf.php</code> & fill in the database details.
